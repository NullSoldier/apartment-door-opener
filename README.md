My apartment complex front door requires keys to get in. I hate keys.

It also has a call box so guests can dial your apartment number and
get forwarded to your phone. If you want to let them in, just press
9 on your phone and the door will open.

This is just a Twilio app that "presses" 9 then hangs up. Enjoy.
